Greetings !

I'm Raghuram, Ph. D. (in Molecular Dynamics, Polymer Science)
I use this github account to upload codes that I've written for post-/pre- processing for LAMMPS MD simulation.
I've also written quite a lot of codes in general and I upload them here as well.
I code using C/Python and I'm experienced using both Windows and Linux OS.
I've experience in managing clusters run using Rocks OS + Cent OS for running MD simulations
