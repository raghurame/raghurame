Greetings !

I'm Raghuram, Ph. D. (in Molecular Dynamics, Polymer Science)
I use this github account to upload codes that I've written for post-/pre- processing for LAMMPS MD simulation.
I've also written quite a lot of codes in general and I upload them here as well.
If you want a readme file, please contact me at raghuramelancheran@protonmail.ch
I'll be uploading readme files for all the codes, but they are not my priority at the moment. 
The codes presented in my account are used for creating LAMMPS data file, calculating order parameters and computing chiral transitions for KMC input. I've written the codes in a general way, so it'll likely work for any polymer (with input as LAMMPS dihedral, dump files)
